    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural<br>
         intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. <br>
         The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym<br>
          chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) while attempts<br> 
          to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called ABI (Artificial Biological Intelligence). <br>
          Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that<br>
           perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving<br>
            its goals.[3] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines <br>
            (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as <br>
            "learning" and "problem solving".[4]<br>

        As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often<br>
         removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[5] A quip in Tesler's <br>
         Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."[6] For instance, optical character<br>
          recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[7] having become a routine <br>
          technology.[8] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully<br>
           understanding human speech,[9] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems <br>
           (such as chess and Go),[10] and also imperfect-information games like poker,[11] self-driving<br>
            cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.[12]<br>

        Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since<br>
         has experienced several waves of optimism,[13][14] followed by disappointment and the loss of<br>
          funding (known as an "AI winter"),[15][16] followed by new approaches, success and renewed<br>
           funding.[14][17] After AlphaGo successfully defeated a professional Go player in 2015,<br>
            artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention.[18] For most of <br>
            its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate<br>
             with each other.[19] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular<br>
              goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),[20] the use of particular tools <br>
              ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[23][24][25] <br>
              Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of <br>
              particular researchers).[19]<br>
        
        The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation,<br>
         planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and <br>
         manipulate objects.[20] General intelligence is among the field's long-term goals.[26]<br>
          Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.<br>
           Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization,<br>
            artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.<br>
             The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology,<br>
              linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.<br>
        
        The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described<br>
         that a machine can be made to simulate it".[27] This raises philosophical arguments about the <br>
         mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. <br>
         These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[32] Some<br>
          people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[33][34] Others<br>
           believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass <br>
           unemployment.[35]<br>
        
        In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent<br>
         advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI<br>
          techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many <br>
          challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.</p>
